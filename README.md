KloudDB Shield serves as a comprehensive security tool designed specifically for Postgres databases, conducting around 100 essential security checks. KloudDB Shield also offers the following additional features. Here is an example of an HTML report generated by our tool https://klouddb.io/klouddbshield_allchecks_aug12.html   :

	* PII Scanner
 
        * HBA Scanner

        * Transaction wraparound detector

	* Inactive Users

	* Unique IPs

	* RDS/Aurora Security reports

	* Password Generator

You can directly download the package from releases section of repo and install the package (for example - rpm for centos and deb package for Ubuntu etc..) . You also need to edit config file after installing the package(see above mentioned blog post for detailed walkthrough)


```bash
# Centos
$ rpm -i <ciscollector file>.rpm

# Debian
$ dpkg -i <ciscollector file>.deb

Usage of ciscollector:
  -r    Run
  -version
        Print version
$ ciscollector -r

## How to run locally(without installing a package) ?

Install and run locally the server

```bash
$ go build -o ./ciscollector ./cmd/ciscollector
# Edit kshieldconfig.toml at path /etc/klouddbshield/kshieldconfig.toml 
$ ./ciscollector -r
```
## RDS Checks

Make sure you have properly configured your AWS-CLI with a valid Access Key and Region or declare AWS variables properly. NOTE - You need to run this tool from bastion host or from some place where you have access to your RDS instances(It only needs basic aws rds describe priivs and sns read privs )
```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="ASXXXXXXX"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="XXXXXXXXX"
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN="XXXXXXXXX"
export AWS_REGION="XXXXXXXXX"
```

## [Sample config file](https://github.com/klouddb/klouddbshield/blob/main/kshieldconfig_example.toml)
Below is sample file - If you are checking for postgres comment out the mysql section or if you are only checking mysql part , comment out the postgres part. Location of the config file is /etc/klouddbshield

```

[postgres]
host="localhost" 
port="5432" 
user="postgres"
dbname="postgres"
password="xxxxx" 
maxIdleConn = 2
maxOpenConn = 2

[app]
debug = true

```
